## INTRODUCTION
This repository contains the files for the Portfolio task for COMP2200/6200 in S2 2021. 

## TECHNOLOGY USED 
This project used the following libraries: 
* pandas 
* numpy 
* matplotlib 
* seaborn
* sklearn 
* scipy 

## PORTFOLIO 1 
### AIM 
The aim of this portfolio was to analyse and explore the cycling data provided. It focused on exploring specific aspects of the data and summarising it so that it was informative for the reader. 

Areas explored include concepts such as: 
* Overall summary statistics 
* Comparing races 
* Inferring data from other fields 

## PORTFOLIO 2 
### AIM 
This portfolio focused on exploring the sports program dataset provided. From here it was required to draw conclusion on participating LGA's and their SEIFA measurements. 

## PORTFOLIO 3 
### AIM 
The aim of this project was the build a predictive model for customer churn. This task focused on classifier models (supervised learning). 

Models used in this task include: 
* Logistic regression 
* K nearest neighbours
